## Overview

**Dermora.ai** is an intelligent mobile health application that addresses the critical intersection of dermatology and mental health. Our platform helps individuals manage chronic skin conditions—eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo—that are deeply affected by mental and emotional well-being.

### The Problem

Dermatological conditions are increasingly recognized as having significant psychological comorbidities. Current research indicates that approximately 33% of dermatology patients experience psychiatric symptoms, yet mental health support remains largely absent from standard dermatological care protocols. Chronic conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo demonstrate high sensitivity to emotional distress, with well-documented correlations between psychological stress, trauma, and disease exacerbation. Despite clear evidence linking environmental factors, emotional well-being, and skin health, patients currently lack integrated tools to holistically track and manage these interconnected aspects of their condition.

### Our Solution

Dermora.ai reimagines dermatological care by creating a comprehensive digital platform that functions as both dermatologist and mental health therapist. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, real-time voice-based therapy, and multi-modal tracking systems, the platform enables patients to understand and actively manage the bidirectional relationship between their emotional state and skin health. This approach represents a paradigm shift from fragmented care to integrated, patient-centered disease management.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Skin Disease Detection

Our platform employs a fine-tuned DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT) model trained on over 50,000 dermatological images to provide accurate classification of eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo. The model demonstrates robust performance across diverse skin tones and photographic conditions, delivering instant diagnostic results with detailed confidence scores. Following each assessment, users complete a contextual questionnaire that creates a personalized, dermatologist-quality consultation experience.

**Technical Specifications:**
- DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT-B/14) architecture
- Training corpus: HAM10000, DermNet NZ, and Figshare Vitiligo datasets
- Multi-class classification with confidence scoring
- Bias mitigation for diverse skin tone representation
- Post-diagnosis contextual assessment protocol

### Intelligent Mood Tracking and Analysis

The platform provides a streamlined interface for logging emotional states, with all data securely stored in NeonDB for longitudinal analysis. Advanced algorithms identify patterns and correlations between psychological well-being and dermatological condition severity, enabling patients to understand their personal trigger profiles.

**System Capabilities:**
- Temporal mood pattern visualization
- Correlation analysis between emotional states and disease exacerbation
- Historical trend identification
- Integration with therapeutic conversation analysis
- Data-driven insight generation

### Solace: Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Mental Health Agent

Solace represents a novel approach to accessible mental health support, utilizing Google Gemini's multimodal capabilities to enable natural, empathetic voice-based therapeutic conversations.

## Privacy and Security Architecture

Data security and patient privacy represent foundational design principles for the Dermora.ai platform.

**Security Measures:**
- **End-to-end encryption** for all voice conversation data using AES-256
- **HIPAA-compliant** data storage with audit logging and access controls
- **Local processing** for sensitive operations to minimize data transmission
- **Anonymized analytics** - aggregated insights never contain personally identifiable information
- **User data sovereignty** - complete data deletion capabilities
- **Transparent privacy policy** - explicit consent for all data collection

**Data Handling Protocols:**
- Medical images encrypted at rest using industry-standard cryptography
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- GDPR-compliant data processing agreements
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for healthcare provider access
